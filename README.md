# What is this repository about? üåü

## I'm really training myself in the language of JavaScript, so I decided to show you guys everything I'm learning and my journey as well.
- Live Demo üí•: https://cheery-dusk-15e1d0.netlify.app/ 
- Local Storage Demo üí•: https://astonishing-churros-f1bd4c.netlify.app/


## In this Repo the tools I used were:

````
1Ô∏è‚É£ JavaScript
2Ô∏è‚É£ HTML 
3Ô∏è‚É£ CSS
````

# The structure of the project is as follows:

## - I separated each topic into folders to be able to access the topics that interest me to review more easily.

## - In each folder you will find the .js files where there will be theory and practice of each topic. You also find the files index.html and styles.css

## - I left very specific comments in each code to identify everything much better and to know what each function does in the code.

## - There are also small exercises where we apply everything learned.

## - I'll leave some ````Demos```` at the top of this README.rd feel free to interact with them.

# A little advice for you: ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó

## I usually use "Prettier" to improve my code and make it look cleaner. It is also super useful for those who are starting to program. I know that when we are beginners in writing code, we usually make mistakes or our code looks messier and we can't read it ourselves.


# Prettier definition
## ``Prettier`` offers support for multiple languages and frameworks. What ``Prettier`` offers is to take your code and "re-format" it based on the defined settings thus maintaining a consistent style. Making it much more readable and without worrying about how you write it initially.
