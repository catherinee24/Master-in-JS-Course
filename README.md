# Doing some basic Javascript practices!! 💯

## I decided to post these basic Javascript exercises because they really helped me improve my skills and logic. They are really basic but they are incredible for anyone who is starting to program. 😮‍💨

## ````feel free to do them if you want to improve even more in programming and if you are a beginner, these exercises will be very helpful.````
